# Campsite Availability Scraping

**This has been updated to work with the new recreation.gov site and API!!!**

This script scrapes the https://recreation.gov website for campsite availabilities.

## Example Usage
```
# Old way
$ python camping.py crawl --start-date 2018-07-20 --end-date 2018-07-23 232448 232450 232447 232770
‚ùå TUOLUMNE MEADOWS: 0 site(s) available out of 148 site(s)
üèï LOWER PINES: 11 site(s) available out of 73 site(s)
‚ùå UPPER PINES: 0 site(s) available out of 235 site(s)
‚ùå BASIN MONTANA CAMPGROUND: 0 site(s) available out of 30 site(s)

# Using request
$ python recreation-gov-campsite-checker/camping.py crawl --exit_code --request "2019-10-11..2019-10-13:232448,232450,232447,232770;2019-11-18..2019-11-21:232448,232450,232447,232770"
There are campsites available from 2019-11-18 to 2019-11-21!!!
‚ùå TUOLUMNE MEADOWS (232448): 0 site(s) available out of 21 site(s)
‚ùå LOWER PINES (232450): 0 site(s) available out of 75 site(s)
üèï UPPER PINES (232447): 142 site(s) available out of 240 site(s)
‚ùå BASIN MONTANA CAMPGROUND (232770): 0 site(s) available out of 30 site(s)

There are no campsites available from 2019-10-11 to 2019-10-13 :(
‚ùå TUOLUMNE MEADOWS (232448): 0 site(s) available out of 21 site(s)
‚ùå LOWER PINES (232450): 0 site(s) available out of 75 site(s)
‚ùå UPPER PINES (232447): 0 site(s) available out of 240 site(s)
‚ùå BASIN MONTANA CAMPGROUND (232770): 0 site(s) available out of 30 site(s)

# Get info of what we're looking for:
$ python recreation-gov-campsite-checker/camping.py crawl_info --request "2019-10-11..2019-10-13:232448,232450,232447,232770;2019-11-18..2019-11-21:232448,232450,232447,232770"
Looking for a place from 2019-11-18 to 2019-11-21 in:
- UPPER PINES
- TUOLUMNE MEADOWS
- LOWER PINES
- BASIN MONTANA CAMPGROUND

Looking for a place from 2019-10-11 to 2019-10-13 in:
- UPPER PINES
- TUOLUMNE MEADOWS
- BASIN MONTANA CAMPGROUND
- LOWER PINES
```

The script also accepts additional options:
- crawl command:
  - --html - print output with html formatting, useful for telegram
  - --only_available - print only available sites
  - --no_overall - if provided, prints out only camps info, no summary line
  - --exit_code - if something is found, exit code is 0, otherwise 61

- crawl_info
  - --html - print output with html formatting, useful for telegram

You can also read from stdin. Define a file (e.g. `parks.txt`) with IDs like this:
```
232447
232449
232450
232448
```
and then use it like this:
```
$ python camping.py --start-date 2018-07-20 --end-date 2018-07-23 --stdin < parks.txt
```

You'll want to put this script into a 5 minute crontab. You could also grep the output for the success emoji (üèï) and then do something in response, like notify you that there is a campsite available. See the "Twitter Notification" section below.

## Getting park IDs
What you'll want to do is go to https://recreation.gov and search for the campground you want. Click on it in the search sidebar. This should take you to a page for that campground, the URL will look like `https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/<number>`. That number is the park ID.

You can also take [this site for a spin](https://pastudan.github.io/national-parks/). Thanks to [pastudan](https://github.com/pastudan)!

## Installation

I wrote this in Python 3.7 but I've tested it as working with 3.5 and 3.6 also.
```
python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
# You're good to go!
```

## Development
This code is formatted using black and isort:
```
black -l 80 --py36 camping.py
isort camping.py
```
Note: `black` only really supports 3.6+ so watch out!

Feel free to submit pull requests, or look at the original: https://github.com/bri-bri/yosemite-camping

### Differences from the original
- Python 3 üêçüêçüêç.
- Park IDs not hardcoded, passed via the CLI instead.
- Doesn't give you URLs for campsites with availabilities.
- Works with any park out of the box, not just those in Yosemite like with the original.
- **Update 2018-10-21:** Works with the new recreation.gov site.

## Twitter Notification
If you want to be notified about campsite availabilities via Twitter (they're the only API out there that is actually easy to use), you can do this:
1. Make an app via Twitter. It's pretty easy, go to: https://apps.twitter.com/app/new.
2. Change the values in `twitter_credentials.py` to match your key values.
3. Pipe the output of your command into `notifier.py`. See below for an example.

```
python camping.py --start-date 2018-07-20 --end-date 2018-07-23 70926 70928 | python notifier.py @banool1
```

You'll want to make the app on another account (like a bot account), not your own, so you get notified when the tweet goes out.

I left my API keys in here but don't exploit them ty thanks.

**Thanks to https://github.com/bri-bri/yosemite-camping for getting me most of the way there for the old version.**
